This web application is a Snack-Along App that allows users to see the nutritional facts of specific snacks that are already there. The user can also add snacks with their specific nutritional facts to find out if they're healthy. They can also edit and delete already populated data as well as their own data they input.

Getting Started:
- Clone the repository: git clone
- Navigate to the project directory: cd SnackAlong

- Start the server: npm start
- The app is running on http://localhost:8888/
